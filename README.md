StudyCircle: Where Students Help Students Win

Description : 
StudyCircle is a peer tutoring site where students assist one another in learning either within or out of school. It's an open, sociable environment in which learning becomes effortless and nourishing. 
Regardless of whether you're stuck in math or nailing biology, you can seek assistance or offer it, on your own schedule.

Problem Statement : 
In most schools and colleges, students silently struggle since they don't receive the assistance they require. Some students are excellent in some subjects but hardly assist others. At the same time, a lot of students can't hire tutors or simply don't dare to ask for assistance. There is a large gap between the ones who can assist and the ones who need it.
StudyCircle wants to close that gap.

Conclusion : 
StudyCircle isn't a new app, it's a fresh way of learning. It reverses the model from competition to cooperation. Where students help students instead of being behind. It's light, welcoming, and designed to develop alongside students. In a world where learning seems to be a struggle and loneliness, StudyCircle creates a bridge one supportive student at a time.
